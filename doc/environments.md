#### Src

**NOTE**: Steps in this section are not strictly necessary to be able to use the Data Analysis Platform. However, the `src` directory contains very useful code for actual data analysis projects (Docker environments, examples of GitLab Pipelines, etc.).

1) Copy all secrets templates from `secrets_templates` to the corresponding `secrets` directory, which Git ignores. 

2) Search for `{{TODO:REPLACE}}` in the `src` directory and fill in all missing values. 

  **TIP**: You can use Visual Studio Code or `egrep` to search for strings in multiple files simultaneously.

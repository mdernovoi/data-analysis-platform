1. Fork the project to your own account.

2. Create a new branch **based on the `main` branch** and name it with a short description of the changes you are working on.

    **NOTE**: Keep your branch synced (`git rebase`) with the mainstream `main` branch.

3. When you are ready to share your code, squash your commits.

4. Submit a pull request from your branch to Data Analysis Platform's `main` branch.

If your patch is accepted, you will be credited in the next release.
